# spotify-lyrics-backend

This is the backend code for a web app built with [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/).

Users sign in with their Spotify account to gain authorisation. It also uses a package called lyrics-finder to search for lyrics based off of the currently playing song and will then send the data to the front end to display the lyrics.

If you want to see the React frontend code for this, you can view it [here](https://github.com/dalebandoni/spotify-lyrics-frontend).
